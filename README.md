The rapid increase in plastic production and improper waste management have resulted in widespread microplastic pollution across oceans, rivers, and even the food chain. These microscopic plastic fragments pose severe threats to marine life, ecosystems, and human health. Detecting and monitoring microplastics in water bodies is a challenging task due to their tiny size, varying shapes, and similarity to organic particles.

To address this environmental crisis, there is a pressing need for an intelligent, automated system capable of real-time microplastic detection and classification using advanced technologies like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and computer vision. Such a system can enable accurate identification of microplastics in water samples, support environmental monitoring, and assist research and cleanup initiatives, promoting a sustainable and cleaner ecosystem for future generations.

Dataset

Dataset Name: Microplastic Dataset for Computer Vision

About Dataset:
This dataset contains high-quality microscopic images of water samples with visible microplastic particles. Each image is annotated and categorized based on the type, size, and shape of the microplastics, making it suitable for training image classification or object detection models for environmental monitoring.

⚙️ Model Training:

The dataset was trained using Google Teachable Machine, an interactive platform that allows building AI models without coding. The training process involved uploading categorized images (microplastic-present and clean-water samples), setting the appropriate parameters, and optimizing the model’s performance for accurate classification.

After achieving satisfactory accuracy, the trained model module was successfully exported and downloaded from Teachable Machine for further integration into a real-time web-based detection system.
